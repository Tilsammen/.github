# About
Welcome! We are Tilsammen - probably better known as the team behind the Younit project. Founded in 2023 alongside Younit itself, we're a collective who all have a passion for coding and want to develop our skills, as well as make life a little bit easier for ourselves - and hopefully others one day!

This organisation is mostly focused on the Younit project as a whole, but we may open our gates to more generalised system-focused tools as our skills get better and we actually get things done. \[lighthearted\]

## Contact
Our [inbox](mailto:tilsammen@younit.dev) is always open, and we're usually online in [these places](https://younit.dev/contact#socials). Feel free to say hello anytime, anywhere! :\]
